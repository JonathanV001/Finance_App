      <h1>What Is a Mortgage?</h1>
      <p>
        An mortgage is a loan used to borrow money from a lender and use that
        money to purchase a home, plot of land, or real estate. The loan is payed
        in a series of regular payments divided into principal and interest.
        The property itself is used as collateral
      </p>

      <h2>Key terms</h2>
      <h3>Interest rate</h3>
      <p>
        This is the annual fee the lender assesses to borrow the funds needed to
        buy the vehicle. A higher credit score or shorter loan term generally
        equals a lower interest rate.
      </p>
      <h3>Annual percentage rate (APR)</h3>
      <p>
        The APR is the total borrowing cost of the loan, including the interest
        rate and other fees, expressed as an annual percentage.
      </p>
      <h3>Down payment</h3>
      <p>
        You will pay this amount to the lender before taking out the loan. It
        will be applied toward the total purchase price. The more you put down,
        the lower your monthly payments will be.
      </p>
      <h3>Monthly payment</h3>
      <p>
        The monthly payment is exactly what it sounds like: the amount you pay
        towards the loan each month. It’s based on the mortgage's term, amount
        and interest rate.
      </p>
      <h3>Loan term</h3>
      <p>
        The loan term or repayment period is the window of time during which
        you’ll make payments on the mortgage.
      </p>
      <h3>Principal</h3>
      <p>
        This is the amount you borrow to purchase the mortgage minus the interest
        and fees. The principal plus the down payment equals the cost of the
        home.
      </p>
      <h3>Total cost of the loan</h3>
      <p>
        This figure includes the principal, interest and fees paid to acquire
        the home.
